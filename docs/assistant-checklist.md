# Collaboration Checklist

- Monitor live commands/output that the user runs (builds, logs, DNS checks) and call out any risks or blocking issues immediately.
- Offer proactive advice when you see opportunities to prevent problems or speed up the work, even without being asked.
- Confirm critical preconditions (DNS, tokens, firewall rules, certificates) before executing commands, and keep the user informed of pending cooldowns or rate limits.
- When offer user to run commands, try it yourself first to ensure it works as expected. If it failed because of syntax, just make a script then run it and check the log output then process it yourself without interrupting me.
