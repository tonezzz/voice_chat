# MCP Server - VMS Integration

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to connect to a CCTV recording program (VMS) to retrieve recorded and live video streams. It also provides tools to control the VMS software, such as showing live or playback dialogs for specific channels at specified times.

## Features

- Retrieve video channel information, including connection and recording status.
- Fetch recording dates and times for specific channels.
- Fetch live or recorded images from video channels.
- Show live video streams or playback dialogs for specific channels and timestamps.
- Control PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) cameras by moving them to preset positions.
- Comprehensive error handling and logging.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- `vmspy` library (for VMS integration)
- `Pillow` library (for image processing)

## MCP-server Configuration

If you want to use `mcp-vms` with Claude desktop, you need to set up the `claude_desktop_config.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
	"vms": {
	  "command": "uv",
	  "args": [
		"--directory",
		"X:\\path\\to\\mcp-vms",
		"run",
		"mcp_vms.py"
	  ]
	}
  }
}
```

## VMS Connection Configuration

The server uses the following default configuration for connecting to the VMS:
- mcp_vms_config.py
```python
vms_config = {
    'img_width': 320,
    'img_height': 240,
    'pixel_format': 'RGB',
    'url': '127.0.0.1',
    'port': 3300,
    'access_id': 'admin',
    'access_pw': 'admin',
}
```

## Installation

### 1. Install UV Package Manager
Run the following command in PowerShell to install `UV`:

```shell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

For alternative installation methods, see the [official UV documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### 2.Install VMS Server
   Download and install the VMS server from:  
   [http://surveillance-logic.com/en/download.html](http://surveillance-logic.com/en/download.html)
   (Required before using this MCP server)

### 3.Install Python Dependencies
   Download the vmspy library:  
   [vmspy1.4-python3.12-x64.zip](https://sourceforge.net/projects/security-vms/files/vmspy1.4-python3.12-x64.zip/download)
   Extract the contents into your `mcp_vms` directory

The mcp-vms directory should look like this:

```shell
mcp-vms/
├── .gitignore
├── .python-version
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
├── uv.lock
├── mcp_vms.py            # Main server implementation
├── mcp_vms_config.py     # VMS connection configuration
├── vmspy.pyd             # VMS Python library
├── avcodec-61.dll        # FFmpeg libraries
├── avutil-59.dll
├── swresample-5.dll
├── swscale-8.dll
```
